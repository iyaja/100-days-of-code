# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!---
### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: July 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I finished a few excercises on the "Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers" course on Udacity. I commited the code to my GitHub.

**Thoughts** The course didn't go as fast as I thought it would. I finished far less than what I expected to complete. But with more focus, I should be able to maintain a better pace in the future.
