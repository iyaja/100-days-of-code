# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Ajay Uppili Arasanipalai

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 4, Wednesday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Finished a few excercises on the "Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers" course on Udacity. Commited the code to GitHub.

The course didn't go as fast as I thought it would. I finished far less than what I expected to complete. But with more focus, I should be able to maintain a better pace in the future.

### R1D2
Continued the Kotlin bootcamp Udacity course. Finished the next few exercises. Commited changes to the repo from yesterday.

Today didn't go that well either. I was able to understand and follow the exercises perfectly, but I felt that I was working too slow, andI'm currently not a far into the course as I thought I'd be.

### R1D3
Note: I missed the hour of code yesterday since I was out all day without my laptop. I will add another day to the end.

Continued the Kotlin bootcamp Udacity course. Finished the section on functions. Commited changes to the repo.

I finally finished the section I've been working on. Today, I sped things up to get the course done faster, but  felt like I didn't have as clear of an understanding of the code as yesterday. At the current rate, it looks like my entire first week will be dedicated to completing the kotlin course.

### R1D4
Started lesson 4 of the "Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers" course. Not much progress. Commited changes to repo.

Nothing interesting today. I wasn't expecting much either. Just started coding to keep up with the challenge. I'm planning on joining the 100DaysOfMLCode challenge too. I expect that there will be some overlap between the two.
