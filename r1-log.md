## Log

### R1D1 
Finished a few excercises on the "Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers" course on Udacity. Commited the code to GitHub.

The course didn't go as fast as I thought it would. I finished far less than what I expected to complete. But with more focus, I should be able to maintain a better pace in the future.

### R1D2
Continued the Kotlin bootcamp Udacity course. Finished the next few exercises. Commited changes to the repo from yesterday.

Today didn't go that well either. I was able to understand and follow the exercises perfectly, but I felt that I was working too slow, andI'm currently not a far into the course as I thought I'd be.

### R1D3
Note: I missed the hour of code yesterday since I was out all day without my laptop. I will add another day to the end.

Continued the Kotlin bootcamp Udacity course. Finished the section on functions. Commited changes to the repo.

I finally finished the section I've been working on. Today, I sped things up to get the course done faster, but  felt like I didn't have as clear of an understanding of the code as yesterday. At the current rate, it looks like my entire first week will be dedicated to completing the kotlin course.

### R1D4
Started lesson 4 of the "Kotlin Bootcamp for Programmers" course. Not much progress. Commited changes to repo.

Nothing interesting today. I wasn't expecting much either. Just started coding to keep up with the challenge. I'm planning on joining the 100DaysOfMLCode challenge too. I expect that there will be some overlap between the two.

### R1D5
Note: While I have been following up with the challenge, I forgot to update the log, so the dates might be inaccurate.

Attended a virtual conference where I expexted to write some code. I learnt a lot about blockchain from the confernce, but didn't actually write code. As a result, I'll add an extra hour to R1D7.

I was a bit disappointed with today. I expected to write some code as a part of a virtual conference, but it ended up being just talks. I did learn from the event, but considering that I didn't write code, I'll try to add an hour to day 7 (don't think I'll have time on day 6).

### R1D6
Note: While I have been following up with the challenge, I forgot to update the log, so the dates might be inaccurate.

Wrote my first code with SQL. Created a very simple database that stores a customer ID and name.

As expected, I was very busy today, and didn't get much time to code. But I included the time I spent at school playing around with SQL. What I wrote was based off the book "Database System Concepts" by Avi Silberschatz, Henry F. Korth, and S. Sudarshan. I have chosen to include it today since it was done independently of my school curriculum. I can't provide a link as the code is currently not with me. Again, not much progress towards my goals for the challenge. I'll write more in weekly update to my medium post.

### R1D7
Finished half of the "classes" lesson on the Udacity Kotlin bootcamp.

While I progressed faster than my average throughout this challenge, I am still disappointed overall at both my pacing and progress towards my goal. I didn't anticipate that the Kotlin course would take this long. If this continues, I'll probably quit the Kotlin course and get started with JS.
